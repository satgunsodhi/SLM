Avoid wash sales: Wait 31 days before repurchasing (lose market exposure), Buy similar but not identical security (sell VTI, buy ITOT), Buy options on different underlying, Double position then wait (caution: increases risk). Example: Own Apple, down $5k. Sell Apple, immediately buy Microsoft (different company = allowed), claim $5k loss. Wash sale penalty: Loss disallowed (increases cost basis of new position - deferred, not lost). Applies: To both buys 30 days before AND after sale. Retirement accounts: Buying in IRA can trigger wash sale in taxable. Track carefully.\"\n",

Calculate: Marginal tax rate on conversion vs expected retirement rate. Convert when: Current rate < future rate, have cash to pay taxes (outside IRA), time for Roth to grow (5+ years). Don't convert when: High bracket now (>32%), insufficient time to benefit, can't afford taxes, RMDs won't push to higher bracket.

Pro-rata rule: If you have existing Traditional IRA balances, conversions are partially taxable (mix of pre-tax and after-tax money). Solution: Roll existing Traditional IRA into 401(k) first (if allowed). Annual: Repeat every year. Benefits same as regular Roth: Tax-free growth, no RMDs. Essential strategy for high earners.\"\n",
